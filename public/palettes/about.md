# Enma's TFH Palette Tool

Did you know you can choose your character's palette using button combinations without having to press start and scroll through all of them manually?
This app lets you see all the character palettes and button combinations needed to choose a given palette. Just click on a character's name to get started!

Please note that for the palette to be successfully picked you __**must**__ hold the buttons down for a bit. Every single complaint I've ever had about it not working was because the user was tapping the buttons instead of holding them.
It will also not work if you have the __menu cancel__ function assigned to any of the buttons used in the combination.

For some reason palettes 37 and 39 are not selectable using button combinations despite there being 60 valid combinations, 18 of which are unassigned.

This website uses the information I compiled on my original [google sheets document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cm6R-gfGUZ_IVQ0OPNlakWyzI_oxhiYDNbZnvNVZkyE)*

Nidra and Baihe weren't out yet last time I updated my data* and I no longer feel the desire to spend time/effort on this project, but if anyone is willing to spend the time getting the pictures of all of their palettes I'll be happy to add them. [Just let me know!](mailto:enma@enmadarei.com)
