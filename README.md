# TFH DATA

A li'l website I've been working on for a couple years, I finally put it on github.

Currently available from [my website](https://enmadarei.com)

## [Palette Tool](https://tfh.enmadarei.com/palettes)
It let's you see the palettes for all the characters and button combinations to choose a given palette.

## Frame Data Tool
Let's you see and compare frame data of two different characters.
This is currently not available since I'm in the process of migrating some stuff so it is broken, coming back soonâ„¢
